# Biman Bangladesh Airlines: Comprehensive Turnaround Simulation

## BACKGROUND & CURRENT STATE

Biman Bangladesh Airlines, the national flag carrier of Bangladesh established in 1972, stands at a critical juncture in 2025. The airline operates a fleet of 21 aircraft, consisting of:
- 4 Boeing 777-300ERs (average age: 10 years)
- 4 Boeing 787-8 Dreamliners (average age: 7 years)
- 2 Boeing 787-9 Dreamliners (average age: 5.5 years)
- 6 Boeing 737-800s (average age: 13.5 years)

The airline currently serves 8 domestic and 24 international destinations across 17 countries. Despite ambitious growth plans to expand its fleet to 47 aircraft by 2034, Biman faces significant profitability challenges, with several routes operating at a loss and financial management issues that require immediate attention.

### Current Financial Issues
- Reported profits of Tk 2.82 billion (approximately $24 million USD) for FY 2023-24, but commercial audit directorate found significant accounting irregularities
- Core airline operations lost Tk 259.1 million in FY 2022-23, with profits only shown by incorporating subsidiary earnings from Biman Flight Catering Centre (Tk 462.37 million) and Biman Poultry Complex (Tk 22.01 million)
- Undisclosed liabilities of Tk 38.66 billion to Civil Aviation Authority for surcharges and taxes
- Tk 9.70 billion in unrecorded interest charges due to late fuel payments to Padma Oil Company
- Employee benefit liability of Tk 10.75 billion not properly accounted for
- Difficulty in servicing loan repayments for 13 aircraft purchases, with repayments totaling $1.04 billion
- Lack of financial transparency, with auditors noting incomplete confidential management reports

### Operational Challenges
- Severe route profitability issues with documented monthly losses:
  * Narita route: Tk 20 crore/month (Tk 166+ crore loss in first 8 months of operation)
  * Manchester route: Tk 1.10 crore loss per round trip
  * Delhi, Kuwait City, Kolkata, and Guangzhou routes also operating at a loss
- Aging Boeing 737-800 fleet requiring replacement or extensive maintenance (6 aircraft are 13.5 years old on average)
- Significant supply chain challenges for aircraft parts and maintenance materials
- Two Boeing 737-800s leased from ALAFCO need replacement by May-June 2025
- Multiple flight cancellations and delays due to maintenance issues and aircraft shortages
- 30% higher non-flying personnel compared to more efficient international carriers
- Inefficient ground handling at Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport causing delays
- Manual processes still prevalent across ticketing, check-in, and operational areas
- Poor on-time performance (consistently below industry average of 80%)
